Congratulations! You're here before the repo has a proper description. You're one of the special ones. This is the companion site of @UKPetitionPosts. The twitter bot's purpose is to show people more of what's going on in government - the stuff that isn't usually covered in the daily news breifings, whereas the purpose of this site is to show just how effective or ineffective the petition process is with bringing about real change. The website is still being fleshed out but for now: please click around to see what you can see, and follow @UKPetitionPosts on twitter to send feedback on the site and/or to get petition updates right in your feed.
