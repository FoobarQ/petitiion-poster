Congratulations! You're here before the repo has a proper description. You're one of the special ones. This is the repo of the bot @UKPetitionPosts and it's companion site. The twitter bot's purpose is to show people more of what's going on in government - the stuff that isn't usually covered in the daily news briefings, whereas the purpose of the site is to show just how effective or ineffective the petition process is with bringing about real change. The website is still being fleshed out but for now, and the bot just needs a little cleaning up.
