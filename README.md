# NOTICE

This project costs a lot of money to keep running; I've ran out. I'll make it active again at some point in the future. I'll make it better and such, and make it active again at some point in the future. 

What follows are the words of a deluded man from the past.

Congratulations! You're here before the repo has a proper description. You're one of the special ones. This is the repo of the bot @UKPetitionPosts and it's companion site. The twitter bot's purpose is to show people more of what's going on in government - the stuff that isn't usually covered in the daily news briefings, whereas the purpose of the site is to show just how effective or ineffective the petition process is with bringing about real change. The website is still being fleshed out but for now, and the bot just needs a little cleaning up.


Here's a bookmarklet that'll link you to the site.
`javascript:(function(){(window.location.origin==="https://petition.parliament.uk"&&window.location.pathname.includes("/petitions/"))?window.location="https://www.petitiontracker.uk"+window.location.pathname.replace(".json",""):window.location="https://www.petitiontracker.uk";})();`

Just:
1. add a random bookmark and edit it
2. set Name to be "Petition Tracker"
3. set Url to be the code above

If you're already on the UK Government's petition website and you click the bookmarklet, it'll direct you to the corresponding tracker page.
If not, you'll be directed to the tracker's homepage.
